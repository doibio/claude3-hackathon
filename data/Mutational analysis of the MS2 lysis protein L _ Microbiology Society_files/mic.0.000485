Three amurins have been shown to act like 'protein antibiotics' by inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis. However, the L lysis protein of the canonical ssRNA phage MS2, a 75 aa polypeptide, causes lysis by an unknown mechanism without affecting net peptidoglycan synthesis. To identify residues important for lytic function, randomly mutagenized alleles of L were generated, cloned into an inducible plasmid and the transformants were selected on agar containing the inducer. From a total of 396 clones, 67 were unique single base-pair changes that rendered L non-functional, of which 44 were missense mutants and 23 were nonsense mutants. Most of the non-functional missense alleles that accumulated in levels comparable to the wild-type allele are localized in the C-terminal half of L, clustered in and around an LS dipeptide sequence. The LS motif was used to align L genes from ssRNA phages lacking any sequence similarity to MS2 or to each other. This alignment revealed a conserved domain structure, in terms of charge, hydrophobic character and predicted helical content. None of the missense mutants affected membrane-association of L. Several of the L mutations in the central domains were highly conservative and recessive, suggesting a defect in a heterotypic protein-protein interaction, rather than in direct disruption of the bilayer structure, as had been previously proposed for L.","context":{"all":{"count":25382440,"mean":10.745874169386397,"rank":3562512,"pct":85,"higher_than":21796109},"journal":{"count":5709,"mean":5.186815554387809,"rank":399,"pct":92,"higher_than":5307},"similar_age_3m":{"count":324641,"mean":14.552499117486699,"rank":61357,"pct":80,"higher_than":262888},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":30,"mean":3.1510000000000002,"rank":3,"pct":90,"higher_than":27}},"authors":["Karthik R Chamakura","Garrett B Edwards","Ry Young"],"type":"article","handles":[],"pubdate":1498867200,"epubdate":1500595200,"dimensions_publication_id":"pub.1090618810","altmetric_id":31549467,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":6,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":2,"cited_by_patents_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":6,"last_updated":1668643200,"score":9.75,"history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000485","added_on":1515724583,"published_on":1500595200,"subjects":["microbiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"readers":{"citeulike":"0","mendeley":"20","connotea":"0"},"readers_count":20,"images":{"small":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=64&score=10&types=aatttwww","medium":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=100&score=10&types=aatttwww","large":"https://badges.altmetric.com/?size=180&score=10&types=aatttwww"},"details_url":"https://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=31549467"})
