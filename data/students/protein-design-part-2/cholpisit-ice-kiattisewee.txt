### ***Will skip Part A as it is optional~~~***

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

***Note taking and relevant research works***

[MS2 Lysis of Escherichia coli Depends on Host Chaperone DnaJ (asm.org)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epub/10.1128/jb.00058-17)

*This article explains how mutation at DnaJ led to resistance to MS2 phage and how mutation of L-protein of MS2 phage recover its lytic property!!! This finding ensures that mutation of L-protein in this campaign can improve capability of MS2 phage and prevent evolution of E. coli to fight with MS2 phage infection.*

[Mutational analysis of the MS2 lysis protein L | Microbiology Society (microbiologyresearch.org)](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.000485)

*This article provides examples of mutations on L-protein that maintain lytic property of MS2 phage. See also this doc and filter for the ones that can still lyse E. coli membrane:* [L-Protein Mutants - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0) — *see intuitive analysis below.*

*Any mutation from 47th residue onward led to abolishment of lytic property.
Deletion of the last 5 amino acid residues will likely abolish lytic property.
Therefore, we should avoid mutation at residues beyond 47th amino acid: underscored part.
The green part can be truncated and still remain functional.*

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a “score” for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are “positive” If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that’s easier
    
    *Below is an output from my run.*

2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - ‣
    
    *Not really, mutations at suggested sites ended up abolishing the lytic property of L-protein according to experimental data.*

    | 29 | C->R | 0 |
    | 29 | C->Stop | 0 |
    | 39 | Y->H | 0 |

    | 53 | N->I | 0 |
    | 53 | N->K | 0 |
    | 53 | N->Q | 0 |
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
    
    *Analysis shown above. This model did suggest mutations beyond experimental dataset but mutations at those suggested positions led to abolished lytic property.*
    
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 
—One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 
    
    *My picks came from the top 10 listed above that hasn’t been tested previously.
    Out of these lists, residues 9/29 is part of the soluble region (residue 1-36) while residue 39 is part of the transmembrane region (residue 39 onward).*

    ***Let’s redo this with more hits? — Analyzed additional 10 hits and include those candidates to the table***
    
    ## **~~~Finalizing Candidates~~~**
    
    Selection Criteria: 2 mutations from Soluble region (residue 1-36), 2 mutations from Intermembrane region (residues 39 onward), and maybe a combination of mutations

    If I have to choose just one, I will go for **Y39L** mutant because I believe intermembrane mutation is more interesting.
    I also copied it here to the shared drive — new sheet [Kiattisewee_Ice_Cholpisit_PLM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Ho8WCnXI7iYK6XSmsMG0diEDQhgZZVR9gfD13MCAgU/edit#gid=1524153801)
    To this point, it looks like everyone who use the language model approach will end up with similar results since we use the same pre-trained model. However, our intuitive selections might differ depending on how we analyze the residues we want to mutate.
    
5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly (Skipped)
    
    Try generating a few variants (or all?), including the original one.
    Can run it by using 8 repeating sequences of the L-protein with “:” as a separator. e.g. METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT
