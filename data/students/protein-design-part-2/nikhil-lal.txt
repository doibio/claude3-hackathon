## L-Protein Mutants

Our goal for this week is to create mutants of the Lysis protein (L-protein) that self-fold without the need for additional proteins within the cell, these mutants are challenging to design as they are in the overlapping encoding region of the coat and reproduction proteins. This is challenging as there are many L-proteins that are likely able to self-fold, but very few of them will be able to overlap with the other significant proteins with the MS2 genome while maintaining functionality of the protein.

Interestingly, a lot of the attempts in this space focus on creating mutations, but Iâ€™m wondering if it makes sense to just expand the gap between the coating protein and the replicase protein to allow for a larger, potentially more complex L-protein. 

To get started I will first design the protein using the available mutation models, but as I explore I intend to find a method for expanding the L protein coding length.

## L-Protein and DNAj Sequence

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.
