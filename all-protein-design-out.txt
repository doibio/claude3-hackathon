    - Intro
        
        Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

    - **Goal:**
        
        Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.
        
    
    ## L-Protein and DNAj Sequence

        ```
        
        Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

    - **Additional Information**
        1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
        2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

        1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier

            If we connect it with the a part, we can see that the result can be seen through the heatmap above. E.g. the 50th AA mutation from K to L is said to have a good high LLR score on part a, which can be seen in the visualization above as yellow-ish colour (the LLR score above 2).

        2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
        
        3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
            
            ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9ad195aa-6e74-47e0-afe2-ea3ca2edf678/1bd96094-c408-491b-8a62-8402dbd43299/Untitled.png)
            
            ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9ad195aa-6e74-47e0-afe2-ea3ca2edf678/f0ee6dcb-47cd-4e51-a4a6-e651803d082b/Untitled.png)
            
            I don‚Äôt know if the result from both sources above is fully correlated. But, we can see that through the LM product, the LLR score for AA no. 1, M mutation into I and T are blue in color or probably have a low LLR score below 0. This then may translates into the 0 in lysis and protein level of the lab result. 
            
            ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9ad195aa-6e74-47e0-afe2-ea3ca2edf678/920ad340-3314-4af4-ac5c-8f7656fed3e5/Untitled.png)
            
            Checking on the positive result, AA no. 30 from R to Q/L not necessarily colored yellow of have LLR score higher than 2. But, from my view, the color itself for those mutations are lighter (lighter green) than the rest (green and blue), which might mean that the score is above 0 at least, and may translates into the 1 lysis and protein level of the lab result. 
            
        4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to.
        
        One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations.

            Overall, the hydrophobicity status is similar to the wild type protein, as the transmembrane region (blue region, 38-60, or 35 onwards) still retain its hydrophobicity showed from the positive score of the Hphob scale. The soluble region (1-34) also retain it‚Äôs hydrophilicity, only changing in the Hphob degree of the mutated region to a more negative value. 
            
        5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
        you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

## ***Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)***

*Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (A-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (L-Protein) protein, the coat protein (cp), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (rep) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.*

BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)*

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier

2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations.

1. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

***Note taking and relevant research works***

[MS2 Lysis of Escherichia coli Depends on Host Chaperone DnaJ (asm.org)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epub/10.1128/jb.00058-17)

*This article explains how mutation at DnaJ led to resistance to MS2 phage and how mutation of L-protein of MS2 phage recover its lytic property!!! This finding ensures that mutation of L-protein in this campaign can improve capability of MS2 phage and prevent evolution of E. coli to fight with MS2 phage infection.*

[Mutational analysis of the MS2 lysis protein L | Microbiology Society (microbiologyresearch.org)](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.000485)

*This article provides examples of mutations on L-protein that maintain lytic property of MS2 phage. See also this doc and filter for the ones that can still lyse E. coli membrane:* [L-Protein Mutants - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0) ‚Äî *see intuitive analysis below.*

*Any mutation from 47th residue onward led to abolishment of lytic property.
Deletion of the last 5 amino acid residues will likely abolish lytic property.
Therefore, we should avoid mutation at residues beyond 47th amino acid: underscored part.
The green part can be truncated and still remain functional.*

    *This is a shortlisted candidates of L-protein mutants that remain functional.*
    
    *Any mutation from 47th residue onward led to abolishment of lytic property.
    Deletion of the last 5 amino acid residues will likely abolish lytic property.
    Therefore, we should avoid mutation at residues beyond 47th amino acid: underscored part.
    The green part can be truncated and still remain functional.*

2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier
    
    *Below is an output from my run.*

2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - ‚Ä£
    
    *Not really, mutations at suggested sites ended up abolishing the lytic property of L-protein according to experimental data.*

    | 53 | N->I | 0 |
    | 53 | N->K | 0 |
    | 53 | N->Q | 0 |
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
    
    *Analysis shown above. This model did suggest mutations beyond experimental dataset but mutations at those suggested positions led to abolished lytic property.*
    
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 
‚ÄîOne easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 
    
    *My picks came from the top 10 listed above that hasn‚Äôt been tested previously.
    Out of these lists, residues 9/29 is part of the soluble region (residue 1-36) while residue 39 is part of the transmembrane region (residue 39 onward).*

    ***Let‚Äôs redo this with more hits? ‚Äî Analyzed additional 10 hits and include those candidates to the table***
    
    ## **~~~Finalizing Candidates~~~**
    
    Selection Criteria: 2 mutations from Soluble region (residue 1-36), 2 mutations from Intermembrane region (residues 39 onward), and maybe a combination of mutations

    If I have to choose just one, I will go for **Y39L** mutant because I believe intermembrane mutation is more interesting.
    I also copied it here to the shared drive ‚Äî new sheet [Kiattisewee_Ice_Cholpisit_PLM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Ho8WCnXI7iYK6XSmsMG0diEDQhgZZVR9gfD13MCAgU/edit#gid=1524153801)
    To this point, it looks like everyone who use the language model approach will end up with similar results since we use the same pre-trained model. However, our intuitive selections might differ depending on how we analyze the residues we want to mutate.
    
5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly (Skipped)
    
    Try generating a few variants (or all?), including the original one.
    Can run it by using 8 repeating sequences of the L-protein with ‚Äú:‚Äù as a separator. e.g. METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT:METRF___QQLLT

### Random Mutagenesis (Skipped, need Rosetta knowledge)
# Class 4: Protein Design II

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the¬†[lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis)¬†(*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the¬†[replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase)¬†(*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

- ***Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

    M‚ÜíT increased the protein score to 5 points
    
    T‚ÜíS Alters the middle region where the molecule interacts with the DNAj.
    
    R‚ÜíL This position in the sequences aligned in Clustal Omega shows no conserved sites, which means a mutation most likely won‚Äôt affect the protein‚Äôs score too much.
    
- **Mutation 2: Mutation in 3 different region within soluble part of the L-protein**

    M‚ÜíI increased the protein score to 5 points
    
    P‚Üí L alters the middle of the protein, where it reacts with the DNAj. Hopefully, this mutation will stop this engagement.
    
    C‚ÜíT I don‚Äôt see the need to modify the molecule further, hence I modified the C which occupies only one position on the soluble part of the sequence.

### **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its **lysis activity** and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

**Main considerations**

- The mutated sequence should keep the lysis activity
- The mutated aa should not be in the segments of the aa sequence that are coded in the genome overlapping other genes of the phage (coat protein - replicase protein)
- Avoid Higly conserved regions
- Evaluate Predicted Folding Structure by AF2

**First Steps: Setting the Background**

**Lysis Protein Sequence (UniProtKB ID:**  https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03609/entry**)**

```

- Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.
    
    1-37 Soluble Domain
    
    38-75 Transmembrane Domain
    

- The Soluble Domain is mainly polar residues, and the transmembrane domainleans towards hydrophobic residues

1. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
- Experimental Data suggest that mutations before 13th residue and after 46th residue will disrupt lysis activity (The folding of the transmembrane domain is likekly affected, and/or disruption of r protein)

1. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
- The data is not fully correlated. Some important considerations (i.e., genomic context) are missing. Tho further custom each PLM for the analyzed proteind could improve that.

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find he amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
    
    Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
    
6. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
7. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

****Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.  

Additional Information

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

### Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

## L-Protein and DNAj Sequence

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]
 (credit and huge thanks to TA Allan Costa)

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

</aside>

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier
    
    <aside>
    üí° I‚Äôm running the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Wv_Wn37iVALTbUrb6lhjhTT9i129RK6f?usp=sharing) using the **[esm2_t33_650M_UR50D](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D)** (with 33 layer / 150M parameters) ****model found [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D).

    </aside>
    
2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 

5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

# Week 4: Design new L-protein

For the design of a new L-protein I plan to try to optimize its stability so that it does not have to use the chaperone protein anymore and it can more easily fold on its own.

## Get approximate complex fold

First I folded the complex of the existing L-protein using AF2-Multimer:

## Improve stability through ProteinMPNN

Run that through MPNN to get the transmembrane part to be redesigned (idea: make their affinity higher so the interaction does not need to be mediated by DNAj).

Protein MPNN itself gave far too many substitutions that did not seem realistic. Moreover, ProteinMPNN does not consider the fact that this is a transmembrane domain. Instead tried to look at individual likelihoods when fixing the others.

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutation analysis of lysis protein from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/ 

List of mutations that were tried and their effect on lysis observed: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpPNnLIaN659eYKPzQsWB2s36j8m1cQvRxKICJp7HHo/edit#gid=0

2. Using [clustalomega](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo) to get the alignments from the BLAST results for L-protein: 

![Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 10.57.37‚ÄØPM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/29369203-32a2-4387-a776-5e78f89fa162/ae57d487-89bd-4aef-8ef7-665a3545d883/Screenshot_2024-03-11_at_10.57.37_PM.png)

This alignment shows us that there are some regions of the protein that are essential for its stability and function (and remain unchanged across its family of proteins or across sequences of the protein in other organisms). Eg: In position 9, 10 (the amino acid S, Q) seems to be important to the function of the protein as it remains stable across all sequences. 

1. There is some other useful information here: 
[https://howtogrowalmostanything.notion.site/L-Protein-Sequence-Design-Considerations-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908](https://www.notion.so/L-Protein-Sequence-Design-Considerations-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=21) 

Asking ChatGPT to further explain some information in the above guide and summarizing this information for my own knowledge: 

- Depending on where the cell starts to ‚Äúread‚Äù the sequence (called Open Reading Frame), different proteins in this case (lysis, coat and replicase) can have encodings where they overlap.
- Mutating a point in the L-protein can then affect the amino acid sequence of the coat or rep proteins too.
- The idea of **Synonymous Mutations** are mutations change the DNA sequence but not the amino acid produced because there are redundancy in the genetic code.

1. 5 mutations that I have come up with are: 

| Position | Wild_Type_AA | Mutation_AA | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39 (Soluble) | Y | L | The LLR score is 2.24, there are no experimental results, pBLAST shows one sequence which differs at this position.  |
| 5 (Transmembrane) | F | Q/R | pBLAST shows variability in this position, LLR score is > 1.5 and other positions (29, 9) have low variability, Not experimentally verified.  |
| 27 (Transmembrane) | Y | R | High LLR score, pBLAST results show variability (a few sequences with Y‚ÜíN), no experimental results yet.  |
| 53 (Soluble) | N | L | High LLR, pBLAST results has one sequences with (N ‚Üí X), not experimentally validated yet.  |
| 22 (Transmembrane) | F | R | High LLR, pBLAST results has variability, not experimentally validated.  |

The above mutations can also be combined with the ones experimentally tested to ‚Äúwork‚Äù (i.e, perform lysis). 

After talking to Manu in Office hours, she suggested I could try to use Af2_Multimer to see if the mutants mutated in multiple residues form the barrel structure of the L-protein or use Alpha Fold to compare the new structures with the original structure. 

For example: 

| Position 1 + Position 2 | Wild_Type_AA | Mutations | Reason  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 39 + 13 | Y , P | Y39L, P13L | Combination of high LLR prediction + Experimentally verified mutation |
| 53 + 18 | N, R | N53R, R18G | Combination of high LLR prediction + Experimentally verified mutation |
| 5 + 44 | F, L | F5Q, L44P | Combination of high LLR prediction + Experimentally verified mutation |

**TBD: AlphaFold structures of these combinatorial mutants**
# Week 4: Protein Design Part II

# 3/5: Pranam Chatterjee‚Äôs lecture

Today Pranam discussed the engineering of Cas9 enzymes, which by nature require adjacent sequences called PAMs in order to make a cut at a certain target sequence.

- ML to predict the PAMs of found Cas9s
- Engineering of existing Cas9s to have different PAMs
- Combination of mutated Cas9s producing SpryC, a Cas9s with no PAM requirement.

Also, creation of oocytes from stem cells (‚Ä¶why would we want to do this?)

Also, computational design of peptides for interaction with target proteins, e.g. for therapeutics. Using machine learning (CLIP) and a dataset of protein-protein interactions to predict the interaction likelihood of different peptide snippets of proteins that are known to interact with other proteins. SnP (Chatterjee et al. 2023, Communications Biology). From there, one can use this model to try generating peptides from the latent space that might bind the protein, then using the CLIP model try to evaluate how well they may bind.

The above (PepMLM), unlike a model like RFDiffusion, can work from just the target sequence, and doesn‚Äôt require the target structure. This is useful in floppy proteins that are sometimes involved in disease.

**Future Outlook**: Right now we can e.g. design binding, design a structure, etc. But the next level of abstraction that needs to happen is‚Ä¶ what sort of effect on a cell will raising/lowering the levels of this protein have? Can we design things so that a cell as a whole e.g. fixes nitrogen, or takes up more CO2?

### random note on radiodurans

Prof. Joe‚Äôs comment on radiodurans, a bacteria which can survive thousands of times more radiation than other organisms, by keeping many copies of its genome to enable templated repairs of double-stranded breaks from radiation. Typically 2-3 double stranded breaks on a single copy is too much for things to repair.
# Class #4: Protein Design (Part 2)

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find the amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
* Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). * Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
6. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
7. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

# Week 4: Protein Design pt. 2

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

## Solution presented in literature

According to [Chamakura et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5446614/), they already found MS2-L protein mutation. 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92d868a0-3e4b-41f8-b921-e9598de33e5e/af541b47-9dda-42b3-b84d-7f366bd65a3c/Untitled.png)

Lodj1, Lodj2, Lodj3 can lysis E. coli without interaction with DnaJ and they lysis even faster than normal MS2-L protein. Therefore, choosing one of these mutations will give you a higher possibility of achieving the goal. 

I will choose Lodj1

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)
    
    I attached the alignment result file below

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

</aside>

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier
    
    ### Answer
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92d868a0-3e4b-41f8-b921-e9598de33e5e/0a51cf4c-e459-4d84-a49b-470fa1c94c34/Untitled.png)
    
    According to recitation, this heatmap is generated by AI trained by guessing the most likely amino acids when the training sets are given with blocking sequence in the middle. Therefore, this result indicates the likely amino acids at each point. 
    
2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
    
    ### Answer
    
    I check the validity of the protein language model using the experimental data given above. I compared the score of protein language model and the lysis functionality obtained in the experimental data. you can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PLDxJBTCQ0bnZHlxsRbwjk-I4x1stJcf?usp=drive_link). 
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92d868a0-3e4b-41f8-b921-e9598de33e5e/da3871ea-eb8c-4fad-85a9-5057f591039b/Untitled.png)
    
    As a result, I could generate the plot above. However, you can see a bipolarity of scores when lysis ability is 0. If you closely look at the calculated score, high scores usually occur when the amino acids converted to STOP codon. Therefore, we excluded cases if the mutation resulted in STOP codon. 
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92d868a0-3e4b-41f8-b921-e9598de33e5e/1b428814-64f8-4c2d-8824-dc111d7725a8/Untitled.png)
    
    Now, you can clearly see that the mutation preserving its original functionality shows a higher score (score>0) tendency. However, this relation is not absolute, and many of the mutations that lost their functionality also showed high scores. 
    
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 
    
    ### Answer
    
    To be independent to DnaJ, mutation in soluble region will be needed since DnaJ bind to soluble region of MS2-L. To list the possible mutation that will retain lysis functionality while becoming independent to DnaJ, I restricted the candidates to mutations shown in the experimental data. Also, I excluded mutations that doesn‚Äôt have lysis functionality because anyway these mutations will not achieve the goal. Now, let‚Äôs extract the mutations that have lysis functionality and sort them with descending order. You can find the code for this [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PLDxJBTCQ0bnZHlxsRbwjk-I4x1stJcf?usp=drive_link).

    Now, we need to choose 5 mutation candidates. I chose three soluble mutations and two transmembrane mutations. For all mutations, I chose the mutations of which score higher than 0. For soluble mutation, I chose mutations that are not conservative. Especially, the soluble region is highly basic, and this property may facilitate the interaction with DnaJ. Therefore, I chose a missense mutation that replaced the basic amino acid with a non-polar amino acid. For transmembrane mutations, there were only two options so I just chose these two.

5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

    I will choose the first mutation above for this practice. 
    
    ```python

    To easily do this, I wrote some functions to create input sequence. 
    
    ```python
    def replace_character(string, position, replace):
        # Ensure position is within the bounds of the string
        position = position-1
        if position < 0 or position >= len(string):
            return "Position is out of the string's range."
    
        # Replace the character at the specified position
        new_string = string[:position] + replace + string[position+1:]
        
        return new_string
    def repeat_string(string, mul):
        # Repeat the string mul times, separated by a colon
        repeated_string = (string + ':') * mul
        # Remove the last colon
        repeated_string = repeated_string.rstrip(':')
        
        return repeated_string
    input_seq = replace_character(protein_sequence, 20, 'W')
    input_seq = repeat_string(input_seq, 8)

    ```
    
    The result of this code is:

    Although the confidence level is very low, it also shows the similar structure as original sequence, we can say the oligomer structure itself doesn‚Äôt change that much. The major difference is the number of alpha helices in one chain. it should be two as in the above picture since those regions remained the same. However, because of the unknown reason, I got this result. structure similarity is as expected since we chose a conservative missense mutation that doesn‚Äôt change the structure but sequence, so it possibly hampers DnaJ binding.

# Week 5: Protein design (part 2)

From the [homework description](https://www.notion.so/Class-4-Protein-Design-Part-2-d55d2d6db430437ea335ed41149e042a?pvs=21).

> Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

# Guiding design of L protein mutants

## Literature review

Mutational analysis of the MS2 lysis protein L

[Chamakura 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/)

- ‚ÄúFrom a total of 396 clones, 67 were unique single base-pair changes that rendered L non-functional, of which 44 were missense mutants and 23 were nonsense mutants.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMost of the non-functional missense alleles that accumulated in levels comparable to the wild-type allele are localized in the **C-terminal half of L**, clustered in and around an **LS dipeptide sequence**.‚Äù
- ‚Äú[The genetic analysis] approach revealed that the host DnaJ chaperone was required for L function, interacting with the **N-terminal**, highly basic domain of L
- the dipeptide sequence LS as a completely conserved motif

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.07.10 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/6644d65f-b63d-4ab2-ad0b-9890b8b40a2d/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_9.07.10_PM.png)

**Figure 2:** We observe that:

- The L protein has four domains, shown on the colored bar.
- Alleles that resulted in lysis defects but nevertheless resulted in protein accumulation are shown above the sequence.
- Amino acid changes that did not affect lytic function are shown below the sequence.
- The green asterisks indicate all possible codon positions where a nonsense mutation could result from a single nucleotide sequence. We do not want to encode a DNA sequence that creates an mRNA transcript that prematurely encodes a stop codon.  Below the sequence

## Annotating sequences in Benchling

Before designing my L protein mutants, I wanted to understand the MS2 phage genome, so I started by visualizing it. I downloaded the DNA sequence of the MS3 phage [from EMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/V00642) and imported the sequence into Benchling. I then annotated the protein-coding regions using annotations [from NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/V00642). The description of the proteins on the NCBI pages shows you the start and end of the DNA sequence of all the proteins; bases 1761..3398 for the L protein.

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.44.49 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/c9464ce7-0757-4ae8-b43d-27d1d1783924/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_9.44.49_PM.png)

Figure 3: NCBI annotation of the L protein of the MS2 phage, including the position of the protein in the genome sequence (1761..3398). 

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.48.29 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/ebe02bdd-fcd9-4a97-b5ea-9c429d32cc93/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_9.48.29_PM.png)

Figure 4: The annotated MS2 phage genome in Benchling. The coat protein is in green and the L protein is in orange. The figure shows that the L protein gene overlaps with genes encoding the coat protein and replicase, respectively. The non-overlapping region is from bases 1728-1760. These may be good candidates to mutate as they won‚Äôt cause issues in the other proteins. If we do change bases in the overlapping regions, we want to choose residues with codons that lead to synonymous mutations in the overlapping genes. 

I next query the L protein on pBLAST and view it using the multiple sequence aligner view. The red regions show highly conserved proteins that we‚Äôll likely want to avoid mutating. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 9.59.01 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/b19667ff-79fc-4c91-9e26-c6707aa66e91/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_9.59.01_PM.png)

Figure 5: The L protein visualized the multiple sequence alignment tool on pBLAST. The red highlights show conserved areas. 

I then annotated these conserved regions on benchling.

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 10.18.00 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/4891c18a-b3a8-41a4-a03f-ecf64bd015ae/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_10.18.00_PM.png)

Figure 6: Conserved amino acids, as indicated by pBLAST in Fig. 5 are annotated in Benchling. 

I then annotated specific amino acids in the L protein where mutations had caused MS2 phage to fail at lysing the host cell. Each annotation contains a note in which mutation broke the lysis function, as indicated in the [L-Protein Mutants spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0) compiled for the class. We probably want to avoid making mutations in regions where mutations frequently led to lysis failure. 

 

![Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 10.51.48 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/4a17f195-b877-4f03-a344-489b5b8e709d/Screenshot_2024-03-10_at_10.51.48_PM.png)

Figure 7: Annotation of mutated amino acids causing failure of lysis in the MS2 bacteriophage. 

As a final annotation, I added the soluble domain and the transmembrane domain, as outlined in the assignment. The soluble domain interacts with DNAj. The transmembrane domain is important for cell lysis activity.  

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

I‚Äôm using a protein language model to find plausible mutations in the L protein that will still lead to correct folding. I‚Äôm using the ESM-2 model ([Lin et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ade2574)) implemented in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd). From the notebook, we generate a heatmap showing the predicted fitness or ‚Äúappropriateness‚Äù of mutations for the L protein sequence. I consider the heatmap score to be a proxy for the likeliness to fold.  

Raw data for the heatmap: 

[protein_mutations_scores.csv](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/adce28d4-a6b8-419e-841b-e3373f29d4c7/protein_mutations_scores.csv)

![Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 11.44.45 AM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/b2a0a270-cfe8-475c-916f-bd537f3db0ad/Screenshot_2024-03-11_at_11.44.45_AM.png)

Figure 8: Predicted effects of mutations on the protein sequence of the L protein in MS2 bacteriophage. Yellow indicates mutations expected to be positive for function while blue suggests it will be negative for function. 

As a sanity check, I compare a few of the fitness predictions from ESM-2 with experimental data in the [L-Protein Mutants spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0). 

| Amino acid position | Amino acid change | Lysis | Protein levels (ND=Not determined) | ESM-2 score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | T‚ÜíI | 0 | 0 | -0.30 |
| 25 | E‚ÜíG | 1 | 0 | 0.45 |
| 29 | C‚ÜíR | 0 | 0 | 2.40 |
| 46 | I‚ÜíF | 1 | 1 | -0.10 |
| 50 | K‚ÜíN | 0 | 1 | 0.42 |
| 56 | L‚ÜíP | 0 | 0 | -1.26 |
| 69 | T‚ÜíS | 0 | 0 | 0.07 |

Table 1: Comparing ESM-2 predicted amino acid mutation fitness with experimental data. 

From Table 1 we see that some of the predictions between ESM-2 match experimental results, like at amino acid positions 3, 25, and 56, while others are not aligned with experimental findings (positions 29, 36, 50, and 69). For position 29, in particular, ESM-2 makes predicts a high log-likelihood for a C‚ÜíR change, however, experimental data suggests this change results in lysis failure. While this validation of ESM-2 is by no means comprehensive, my analysis is that I should not update to hard on the ESM-2 predictions. Still, lacking better information, it probably makes sense to use ESM-2 to rule out certain amino acid changes and choose ones with a high log-likelihood ratio.   

### L protein mutants 1-3

Here, I describe my method for choosing the first three mutant L protein sequences. The factors I consider are as follows:

- Do not mutate amino acids in highly conserved regions as indicated by pBLAST
- Do not make mutations that result in lysis failure as indicated in existing experimental data.
- Do not make mutations in regions of the L protein that overlap with the coat protein and replicase protein of the MS2 bacteriophage.
- Do make mutations that have a high log-likelihood as indicated by ESM-2.

I use my annotated L protein sequence in Benchling and ESM-2 to conform to these criteria. 

![Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 12.11.02 PM.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/2dbb12a1-9143-4426-8844-15e9e04da021/Screenshot_2024-03-11_at_12.11.02_PM.png)

Figure 9: The non-overlapping region of the L protein is highlighted, with conserved regions shown in light brown and specific mutations resulting in lysis failure shown in yellow (the exact amino acid changes resulting in lysis failure are seen in the annotation details). 

I look for amino acid changes from positions 18-27 that are scored highly by ESM-2. I avoid the conserved amino acids in positions 18, 20, 21, and 25-27. That leaves positions 19 and 22-24 suitable for modification. In position 23 there is a lysis failure of the codon encoding the K amino acid is changed to a stop codon (UAA), so we‚Äôll avoid this as well. 

All of these proteins are in the soluble domain of the L protein which interacts with DNAj. Changes in the soluble region don‚Äôt significantly change the structure since this region is not compactly folded as seen in the original structure (Fig 1a). 

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b04d387-86d9-4590-b9bb-46e9b3e07f66/44e15165-e3fd-4520-b1d3-0e16ecdfdf17/Untitled.png)

Figure 10: ESM-2 predictions for amino acid changes from the non-overlapping region of the L protein from amino acid position 18-27. 

**Mutant 1**

- For Mutant 1, I make an amino acid change in L protein amino acid position 22, which corresponds to bases 1741-1743 in the MS2 genome.
- We see from Figure 10 that the highest-ranked amino acid change is F‚ÜíR with a log-likelihood score of 1.60, so let‚Äôs go with this mutation.
- The current sequence is AAG for the forward strand, which turns into UUC during transcription, with UUC encoding phenylalanine (F).
- To change F‚ÜíR, we can change the mRNA sequence to CGA, CGG, CGC, or CGU ‚Äì all of these encode arginine (R). Let‚Äôs use CGC so that we go from UUC‚ÜíCGC. That means we need to change the forward strand from AAG‚ÜíGCG

## Hypothesis: L proteins assemble into pore-forming protein complexes

HTGAA TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it reveals a channel-like complex.

# Weekly assignment 4

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find the amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
6. * Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). * Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
7. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
8. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works
9. **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

## L-Protein and DNAj Sequence

**Lysis Protein Sequence (UniProtKB ID:**  https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03609/entry**)**

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)
3. Additional Information about the sequence is linked here - [https://www.notion.so/howtogrowalmostanything/L-Protein-Sequence-Information-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/L-Protein-Sequence-Design-Considerations-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=21)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

</aside>

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier
2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 

4. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

# Mutations

To choose the mutations, I am gonna take into account the information provided by the logo, the experimental data of the tested mutations, and the IA model predicting mutations scores.

1. First we can see that the F in the position 5 of the original sequence is not highly conserved in the logo, as the mutation F‚Üí S can be found in evolution. The phenylalanine is a hydrophobic residue in a soluble domain with no inner core, this is not common and doesn‚Äôt contribute to the protein stability, in line with this, the change observed in the logo is for a polar residue. When we examine the language model predictions, the fifth position can is highly yellow, indicating that changes in this position could be positive. There is no experimental data available. I propose this mutations to try to achieve a change in the protein activity :
    1. F‚Üí S position 5
    2. F‚Üí Q position 5
    3. F‚Üí P position 5
2. When we look at the C 29 in the heatmap of the language model, it appears almost every change is beneficial, but when we look at the logo, it is a really conserved position. Changing this cysteine for asparagine doesn‚Äôt produce lysis as shown by the experimental results(N). However, the heatmap assigns a high score to the change to an R. We could use this mutation to asses if this position can really  be changed.
    1. C‚Üí R position 29
3. In the soluble region we can find the amino acid E in the position 61. This amino acid has a negative polar charge and as shown in the logo, can be changed by Aspartic acid which has the same negative charge. Although this is not a top score mutation in the language model,nor has experimental data, it has happened in the evolution:
    1. E‚Üí D position 61
4. Again in the soluble region, the T 68 can be changed by an E according to the sequence logo, although the differences in the chemical proteins of both amino acids.
    1. T‚Üí e position 68
# Week 4: Protein Design Part 2

# Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

Rules:

1. Avoid mutations in highly conserved regions
2. Make mutations that have a high log-likelihood, per ESM-2.
3. Do not make mutations that result in lysis failure as indicated in experimental data.  
4. Do not make mutations in regions of the L protein that overlap with the coat protein and replicase protein:

## Rule 1: Avoid mutations in highly conserved regions

I blasted the **L-Protein sequence** using pBlast and viewed it in Mutiple Alignment Viewer to visualize what residues are conserved (red) and what residues seem to be open to mutation. The green section represents the soluble domain and transmembrane protein (blue).

These are the residue positions in the soluble domain and transmembrane protein that have evolutionary mutations and therefore the positions I would want to mutate:

1   2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11 12 15 16 19 22 23 24 31 32 34
M E T R F P Q Q Q  T  S   T   R  F   K   H   R   Q   R

## Rule 2: Make mutations with a high log-likelihood, per ESM-2.

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook.

![This tells me STOP codons are predicted to result in a low functioning protein and that any other mutation would improve the sequence.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5eb40168-7ad8-49c6-93c8-7c4ba7999eea/70865c57-c68e-4995-90ca-5f426b389bac/Stop_Codons.png)

This tells me STOP codons are predicted to result in a low functioning protein and that any other mutation would improve the sequence.

## Rule 3: Avoid mutations that result in lysis failure (<1) per the experimental data.

**Does the [experimental data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) correlate with the scores from the notebook in (1) ?** 

Of the positions that were not well conserved, I mapped their experimental mutations and ELM scores. For some residues there is polarities, where a functioning lysis was negatively scored and vice versa, especially in the Transmembrane Region.

Soluble Domain:

Of the non-conserved positions where there wasn‚Äôt experimental data, I used the heatmap and scores to look for the highest scoring AA Mutations:

![heatmap.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5eb40168-7ad8-49c6-93c8-7c4ba7999eea/1b302a97-3e7d-4d88-b811-28c12742d11e/heatmap.png)

4R Low positives
5F High Positives
7Q Mostly negatives
12T Mostly negative, low positives
16T Mostly negative, low positives
22F R, S had higher scores
24H > S, L, R (highest scores)

38L all negative scores
58S > L,Q (had positive ESM-2 scores, otherwise negative)
59L all negative scores

## Rule 4: Do not make mutations in regions of the L protein that overlap with the coat protein and replicase protein (or be careful to preserve those proteins)

![Untitled.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5eb40168-7ad8-49c6-93c8-7c4ba7999eea/759bbdc5-7306-4a58-a898-ff58b395f48b/Untitled.png)

Non-overlapping region exists between position 17-28. That helped filter the results from above.

1. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region.

# Protein Design (Part 2)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

I chose to use the first approach: mutagenesis using protein language models. To get started, I looked through current literature on the MS2 bacteriophage and the lysis protein (L-protein).

### Literature Review

From the HTGAA project description:

> *Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (A-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (L-Protein) protein, the coat protein (cp), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (rep) protein [Fig. 1]. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism.*

Figure 1. MS2 bacteriophage genome (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5446614/)

For this project and this particular approach, the L-protein is the target of interest. The goal is create L-protein mutants that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. The full project outline can be read in the **[Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21)**.

The L-protein has a soluble domain (green) which is responsible for interaction with DNAj and a transmembrane domain (blue) which affects the phage‚Äôs lysis activity.

Lysis protein sequence (source: https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03609/entry#sequences)

In the paper by [Chamakura et al. (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/), they conducted random single base-pair mutations and noted the effect they had on the phage‚Äôs ability for lysis (cell death). This data was tabulated into an [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0) and I used this for analysis later on.

### Determining Regions for Mutations

To visualize everything, I input the [MS2 phage genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/V00642) into Benchling, translated the region that coded for the L-protein (1678-1905), added annotations for the L-protein domains, and added annotations for the coat protein and replicase protein which overlap with the encoding region for the L-protein (Fig. 2).

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/9e6f124a-3e70-43f6-8496-2338ce4a8ad2/Untitled.png)

Figure 2. Benchling screenshot of MS2 L-protein with additional areas of interest (labelled in image).

**Conserved Regions**

I wanted to see what areas of the L-protein I should not mess with (i.e. highly conserved), so I used [BlastP](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to visualize the conservation areas (Fig. 3) then added those to my Benchling genome.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/dd83246d-9b6a-4a4b-8b8e-ae03658de193/Untitled.png)

Figure 3. BlastP of MS2 L-protein sequence. Highly conserved areas highlighted in red.

I also wanted to take into consideration whether or not mutations to the L-protein would affect the coat protein or replicase. From Fig. 2, I can see that there‚Äôs a region of the L-protein that does not overlap with either the coat protein or replicase (in the soluble domain), so that would be a good location for mutations. However, the transmembrane domain overlaps entirely with replicase, meaning any edits made to that domain could affect the replicase protein. Thus, I also blasted the replicase sequence to see if it had any conserved regions that overlapped with the L-protein (Fig. 4).

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/fd155aab-89eb-4181-8863-f133ee1fcd1f/Untitled.png)

Figure 4. BlastP of MS2 replicase. Highly conserved areas highlighted in red.

From Fig. 4, we can see that replicase is only conserved after about the 270th amino acid (aa), meaning there are no conserved regions of replicase that overlap with the transmembrane domain.

**Previous Experimental Data**

Using the previously mentioned [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0) which outlines point mutations to the L-protein and their effect on lysis, I added annotations to my Benchling genome for which amino acids were mutated and whether lysis occurred or not (Fig. 5).

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/5170a967-3a1e-483f-8be9-0d80980840a6/Untitled.png)

Figure 5. MS2 phage genome in Benchling with: L-protein translation (noted in dark blue), replicase protein (light green), coat protein (pink), start and stop codons (orange), conserved regions of L-protein (grey), mutations that caused lysis failure (beige), and mutations where lysis still occurred (green).

**ESM Score**

Using a protein language model (ESM) [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) for the L-protein sequence, the model produced a score for each amino acid position on the effect on the protein if it was mutated to a different amino acid. A positive score is supposed to be considered positive for the function of the protein.

To determine how accurately this protein language model was with predicting ‚Äòpositive‚Äô mutation outcomes, I compared it to the experimental data from the previous section (Fig. 6).

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/056d3677-c3f1-4bcb-aea4-b5e75dc25a67/Untitled.png)

Figure 6. ESM score vs experimental lysis result for same amino acid mutations in L-protein.

From this, it looks like there‚Äôs quite a bit of spread of what the scores are when lysis either occurs or not after a mutation. Thus, I calculated the average score for mutations where lysis did occur (-0.37) and used this as a reference, meaning for my chosen mutations I would use the one with a score closest to this value. I recognize this is a fairly arbitrary measure, but I thought it could be better than picking randomly.

### Choosing Mutations

When choosing spots for mutation, I used the following guidelines as constraints:

- Not in areas of overlap with coat protein
    - Note: when modifying transmembrane domain, cannot avoid overlap with replicase
- Not in conserved regions of L-protein
- Not in spots where mutations have previously been tried and caused lysis failure
- Not in spots with a start or stop codon
- Preference for spots where mutations had never been tried experimentally

The aim was a total of 5 L-protein mutants, with 2 mutated in the soluble region and 2 mutated in the transmembrane region.

**Mutation 1**

- Soluble domain
    - Restricted to area of non-overlap with coat protein
    - Region: 18 - 27aa (Fig. 7)
- Position for mutation: 22
- Mutation: F ‚Üí Y

### Checking Mutations

To compare the mutated L-proteins against the natural L-protein, I used AlphaFold2 to predict the 3D structures of the proteins.

For the natural L-protein, it can be seen that the transmembrane region is an alpha helix with quite a bit of confidence (IDDT value) and the soluble region prediction is very low confidence (Fig. 9).

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05296496-755f-47f2-bda8-ed646a5e3682/b9f2b69f-103f-431a-acf1-8ecb95f82291/Untitled.png)

Using the rank 1 model, I then visualized the natural L-protein in PyMol (Fig. 10).

Figure 12. L-protein mutants 1 to 5 aligned with natural L-protein.

It appears the soluble domain is the most affected by mutations, however it also is the region of lowest confidence in AlphaFold2, thus it‚Äôs hard to tell how accurate that part of the model is.

Another check I did was to the replicase protein. As mutation 3, 4, and 5 were within the genomic sequence for replicase, I translated replicase the modified genome and compared to the original protein sequence. Mutation 4 had no effect on the replicase protein sequence, while mutation 3 and 5 each caused one amino acid change in the protein sequence. 

I was unable to assess the structure of the replicase protein made from mutation 3 and 5 due to AlphaFold2 continually timing out on my attempts. However, the protein sequences are listed below.

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the [Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to **create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj.** Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

## 1.2 Conserved sites

I submitted the  [alignment from BLAST results for L-protein](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link)  to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments). But I also used [NCBI MSA viewer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/msaviewer/?key=NCID_1_378007_130.14.22.10_9147_1710299468_2706628290_0MetA0__S_NC_PhyloTree&coloring=cons) to see differences and conserved sites.

## 1.3 Known mutational effects from research

## MS2 genome

MS2 genome codes for: 

- Mat, the maturation or **attachment protein** (one molecule per virion, named as **A** in MS2)
- a major capsid protein (Coat)
- RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or replicase (Rep)
- L protein: which is overlapping the coat and rep region (in purple)

Taking into account that L protein is overlapping the coat and rep region, we should mutate only the non overlapping region to don‚Äôt affect the other proteins (position 1728-1760)

## L protein

### Structure

4 domains:

1. **N-terminal domain**:  positively charged domain, highly basic, ‚Äúthe simplest notion is that it is in the cytosol, as it interacts with DnaJ‚Äù
    
     ‚Äúthe lytic function of L requires an interaction with the host chaperone DnaJ, and that this requirement could be by passed by **deletion of the basic N-terminal domain ‚Äú** 
    
    ‚ÄúThe simplest interpretation is that even in the dispensable N-terminal Domain 1, missense changes can occur that block function. ‚Äú
    
2. **Domain 2**: hydrophobic, rich in beta-branched aliphatic residues 
3. **LS**: dipeptide conserved motif
4. **C-terminal domain**: C-terminal truncations were found to be non-functional 

Studies suggest that L makes a specific protein-protein contact that depends on these* mutationally sensitive residues, rather than acting as a membrane-disrupting peptide or an oligomeric lytic factor. 

***L44V, F47L, F47Y, S49T (similar a S49C), F51L y L56F** 

- Mutations:
    - S49C, conferred an absolute lysis deffect

‚ÄúThus, although MS2 L, and, by extension, the other L proteins are undoubtedly membrane proteins, canonical requirements for a simple TMD cannot be met. ‚Äú

Models for the recruitment of the PG biosynthetic complexes to sites of negative membrane curvature have been proposed and supported. Disruption of such a system by L interacting with a membrane-embedded target protein would account for the **ability of L proteins to effect lysis without inhibiting net incorporation of PG into the existing wall,** as has been reported for MS2 L [32, 33]. Thus interaction of L with its target, perhaps via attraction to distorted membrane, would lead to a lytic catastrophe. To address this general hypothesis for L lysis, experiments are underway to assess the distribution of L molecules relative to the sites of PG biosynthesis.

# Making sequence variants

## information

In this homework we will be doing the following steps. Step 2 might vary from student to student

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from [Chamakura et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/)  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)
3. Additional Information about the sequence is linked here - [https://www.notion.so/howtogrowalmostanything/L-Protein-Sequence-Information-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/L-Protein-Sequence-Design-Considerations-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=21)

### **Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models**

[data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)

Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier

Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - **[11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing)**

First check, **does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ?** This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence.

### Heatmap

Anything highlighted in **yellow is a mutation that is expected to be positive** for the function of the protein and anything in blue is a bad mutation for the protein.

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5ae6176a-2ab4-4351-b913-a36ec35a4a13/39868c38-1bbf-447f-81a8-6fd6f0c8a3a0/Untitled.png)

| Amino Acid Position
 | Amino Acid Change
 | Lysis
 | score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 18 | R->G | 1 | -0.8474 |
| 44 | L->V | 0 | -0.6823 |
| 44 | L->P | 1 | -1.5864 |
| 49 |  S -> C | conferred an absolute lysis deffect | -1.5972 |
| 69 | T->S | 0 | 0.0717 |

I interpret that based on the heatmap, the more negative the value is, the worse the mutation is for lysis function, but the computational results do not represent completely the experimental results, for instance among the mutations compared the mutations T69S or L69S were supposed to get the lower scores but as they have proved obstacle to the lysis function. 

!https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic.notion-static.com%2F8fb58690-ee50-4584-b9fd-ca9b524f56aa%2Fgoogle-drive-icon-19632.png?width=200&userId=&cache=v2

1. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. **2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region** (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and **2 of them must be in the soluble region**.Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations. 

Taking into account that the L protein genes overlap the coat and rep genes, but is encoded on a different ORF, I will consider 3 mutations within the non overlapping region (position **17 to 28**), one overlapping coat region and the last one overlapping rep region. Besides, I‚Äôll conserve the conserved regions and the LS domain. Note:  transmembrane region is composed of some of the last 35 residues and the soluble region by the first 34 aa. Likewise, I won‚Äôt be changing any of the conserved sites.

# Class #4: Protein Design (Part 2)

> Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

# Week 4: Protein design (Part 2)

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find he amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
    
    Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
    
6. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
7. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works

2 peptides were designed (P1: WRSGAAALELWE; P2: HLYGVAAARHKE) + 1 sequence from the Article (FLYRWLPSRRGG)

the three molecule prove to attached to different parts of the protein, whether they were run alone or the three at once. The binding sites correspond to loops (hydrophilic part) of the enzyme, proving that it may be a good place to try the interference when designing peptides.

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project description here -

****Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other approaches. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

In this homework we will be doing the following steps. Step 2 might vary from student to student

Additional Information

1. using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits)
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)
3. Additional Information about the sequence is linked here - [https://www.notion.so/howtogrowalmostanything/L-Protein-Sequence-Information-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=4](https://www.notion.so/L-Protein-Sequence-Design-Considerations-7a29684affaa4e3b9adf070cbb7c9908?pvs=21)

## L-Protein Mutants

Our goal for this week is to create mutants of the Lysis protein (L-protein) that self-fold without the need for additional proteins within the cell, these mutants are challenging to design as they are in the overlapping encoding region of the coat and reproduction proteins. This is challenging as there are many L-proteins that are likely able to self-fold, but very few of them will be able to overlap with the other significant proteins with the MS2 genome while maintaining functionality of the protein.

Interestingly, a lot of the attempts in this space focus on creating mutations, but I‚Äôm wondering if it makes sense to just expand the gap between the coating protein and the replicase protein to allow for a larger, potentially more complex L-protein. 

To get started I will first design the protein using the available mutation models, but as I explore I intend to find a method for expanding the L protein coding length.

# Class 4: Protein Design (Part 2)

### 

- **Part A (From Pranam)**
    1. **Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:**
        
        [**https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M**](https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M)
        
    2. **Find the amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence**
    3. **Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)**
    4. **To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]**
    5. **Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
    * Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). * Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.**
    6. **After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.**
    7. **Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works**
- **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**
    - Project
        
        Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.
        
        Goal:
        
        Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

        **Additional Information**

        3. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link .  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

        ## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]
        
        <aside>
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.
        
        </aside>
        
        1. **Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier**
        2. **First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence.** 
        3. **Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 
        
        One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations.** 
        
        First using AlphaFold2 the L-protein 3D structure was generated and visualized in Chimera:
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/96854c7d-1453-4890-af5a-5a005f793f4e/Untitled.png)
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/c6f7773e-1376-43db-8532-2629704da4f8/Untitled.png)
        
        The IDDT graphic shows a high folding confidence in the AA position where the alpha helix is formed. Two parts are visible, corresponding to the soluble and not soluble part of the protein. 
        
        The protein sequence was analized as well. First, in order to identify the conservative sites of the protein, a MultiBlast was done:
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/789717f7-9a32-45b5-b4d1-2762cf4a718c/Untitled.png)
        
        As is seen in the picture above, the majority of the protein shows the be conservated, which will be considered to select the mutants. So, further analysis is necessary. 
        
        Using protein language models, the effect of predicted mutations was obtained:
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/5a022c07-780c-4491-a62f-b7754e60c636/Untitled.png)
        
        1. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - ‚Ä£
        
        The table with experimental mutations was filtered, keeping only the mutations that mantein the lysis and protein levels. That occurs between AA 13-46.  So that is the range considered 
        
        | Position of the mutation in L | Base Pair Changed | Amino Acid Position | Amino Acid Change | Lysis | Protein Levels (ND=Not determined) |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | 38 | C->T | 13 | P->L | 1 | 1 |

        | 52 | A->G | 18 | R->G | 1 | 1 |
        | 53 | G->T | 18 | R->I | 1 | 1 |
        | 89 | G->A | 30 | R->Q | 1 | 1 |
        | 89 | G->T | 30 | R->L | 1 | 1 |
        | 92 | G->T | 31 | R->I | 1 | 1 |
        | 131 | T->C | 44 | L->P | 1 | 1 |
        | 131 | T->C | 44 | L->P | 1 | 1 |
        | 133 | G->C | 45 | A->P | 1 | 1 |
        | 136 | A->T | 46 | I->F | 1 | 1 |
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/be485f01-fec9-4577-91e6-897e97e761f6/Untitled.png)
        
        In yellow is shown the part of the sequence that will be considered for the mutation. 
        
        Next, the two results are compared:
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/63459c55-f592-4164-a6a9-adea84467f83/Untitled.png)
        
        Now the no overlaped sites are between AA 17-28 
        
        ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/302cc312-730f-4271-b146-dc7b2ae21f55/6821c61e-ad6b-4fb9-be6a-d01540132cfd/Untitled.png)
        
        Some not too conservate site will be changed, considering soluble part which would be interacting with chaperone so if they are changed, there is a chance that the protein is still stable enough but not interacting properly with the chaperone.

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find the amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID: [P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
    
    
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
    
    
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
    
    
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
* Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). * Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
    
    
6. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
    
    
7. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Mandatory for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners. **Due at the start of class March 12
This homework requires computation that might take you a while to run. So please get started early.**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project description here on Lisa‚Äôs notes- [https://www.notion.so/howtogrowalmostanything/How-to-Grow-Almost-Anything-2024-63a45d6c8f934456b70e30eee86f9b78?p=8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e&pm=c](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21)

### **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

### **Mar. 7 - Recitation**

**The Goal of mutated L-protein**

- **make lysis faster**
- **make DNAj less-dependent**

### **L-Protein and DNAj Sequence**

**Lysis Protein Sequence (UniProtKB ID:**  https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P03609/entry**)**

```

```

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

**Additional Information**

1. Using the mutational analysis of lysis protein from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775895/  Here is a list of some mutations and their effect on lysis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) [Three columns highlighted ! Please copy the sheet before any edits).
    
    
2. In the last class, we used pBLAST to find evolutionary sequences from other organisms and visualized it using clustalomega. BLAST results for L-protein are here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link.  You can upload it to clustalomega - https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo to get the alignments. Usually a good idea to not make mutations in the conserved sites (the amino acid positions where you see no changes in the alignments)

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

</aside>

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier
    
    
2. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
    
    
3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
    
    
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites -  both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to. 

One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations.

5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida]
you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the **assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein***,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

‚ö†Ô∏è This approach is probably not going to work. Because the 
You can also try co-folding just the soluble domain with the AlphaFold2 complex instead of the whole sequence. You might notice that Af2 is not good at predictions here so it might be worth while to also try just folding the soluble domain.

‚ö†Ô∏è This requires learning about an entirely new tool. May not work at all and is computationally expensive to try. Manu will have office hours over the weekend if you want to try this approach. This is an older way of doing things. Rosetta has forcefields that can be used to compute the structure of a protein sequence as well - It takes significantly longer.

    When we change any dihedral angle of amino acids 1-50, we observe that chain B is not affected by the changes in chain A. This is because, for EDGE 1-50, EDGE 51-100 is like being in a parallel universe with no upstream or downstream relationship. In this case, the FoldTree can be understood as representing two separate polypeptide chains: 1 + (51-100) and 1-51.

# Week 4: Protein Design (Part 2)

### **Part A (From Pranam)**

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for MIT/Harvard Students and Committed Listeners.¬†**Due at the start of class March 12**

</aside>

1. Sign up for HuggingFace and request access for PepMLM:
    
    https://huggingface.co/ChatterjeeLab/PepMLM-650M
    
2. Find the amino acid sequence for SOD1 in UniProt (ID:¬†[P00441](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00441/entry)), a protein when mutated, can cause Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In fact, the A4V (when you change position 4 from Alanine to Valine) causes the most aggressive form of ALS, so make that change in the sequence
3. Enter your mutated SOD1 sequence into the PepMLM inference API and generate 4 peptides of length 12 amino acids (Step 5 takes a while so you can also just pick 1 or 2 peptides)
4. To your list, add this known SOD1-binding peptide to your list: FLYRWLPSRRGG [from -https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/11/1451]
5. Go to AlphaFold-Multimer (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). This is similar to what you did for homework last week but instead for a protein-peptide complex
- Set model_type: alphafold2_multimer_v3 (this model has been shown to recapitulate peptide-protein binding accurately:¬†https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2022.959160/full). * Add your query sequence - Its the SOD1Sequence:PeptideSequence. : is important.
1. After running AlphaFold-Multimer with your 5 peptides alongside your mutated SOD1 sequence, plot the ipTM scores, which measures the relative confidence of the binding region.
2. Provide a 1 paragraph write-up of your results and be sure to cite the relevant works

## **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

</aside>

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the¬†[lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis)¬†(*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the¬†[replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase)¬†(*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

You can read more about the final project in the¬†[Final Project Page](https://www.notion.so/Group-Final-Project-8945a45ee86b486aa62c79b0cfff119e?pvs=21).

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

## L-Protein and DNAj Sequence

Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Designing these mutants with good computational confidence is hard. It will show you limitations of some of the structure based models. Ultimately you can pick various combinations of mutations and get lab results and then decide to pick the next round of mutations. But this assay won‚Äôt be easy to run at scale in this class. So using the information below you can either make a best guess or you can use the strategy Allan was talking about during recitation. Contact Manu or Allan if you need one on one help.

</aside>

1. Run this¬†[notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing)¬†to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein. We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier

3. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence.
    
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1eb2b1fa-af78-45d8-af9b-4a18aaed459d/38141c60-07af-4a09-be51-12742c9801bc/Untitled.png)
    
    The results seem to correlate to the notebook output in (1). This shows some degree a feasibility in the protein model‚Äôs prediction of mutation outcomes. 
    
4. Using information about effect of protein mutations at these sites - both the scores and the experimental data in the drive, come up with 5 mutations for each student along with how you came up with them and why you believe they would work. 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the transmembrane region (refer to notes above on what amino acid positions these are) and 2 of them must be in the soluble region . Remember that you can also use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to.
    
    
    | Position | Wild_Type_AA | Mutation_AA | LLR_Score | Mutation |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 50 | K | L | 2.56146395 |  |
    | 29 | C | R | 2.39542651 | Lysis = 0, Protein = 0 |
    | 39 | Y | L | 2.24177742 |  |
    | 29 | C | S | 2.04314995 |  |
    | 9 | S | Q | 2.01432312 |  |
    
    One easy way to generate sequence mutations could be to look for residue positions and mutations that are have a positive mutational effect either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1. And pick a combination of those mutations.
    
5. You can utilize Af2_Multimer to generate a Multimeric Assembly [TA: Ben Arias-Almeida] you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because - A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it¬†*assembles*¬†to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane. Our TA Ben Arias-Almeida discovered that when we predict the¬†**assemble of 8 structures of the lysis protein**,* it indeed reveals a channel-like complex.

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis).

In this homework we will be doing the following steps. Step 2 might vary from student to student

### Conserved Sites

I fed the [result from BLAST](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQeuwL9WiO16bw6Lb8z-TVpbWIoAF4EH?usp=share_link) to Clustal Omega to get a reference for the conserved site. Potential conserved sites: 21, 25, 28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 37, 40, 42, 44, 46, 50, 51, 52, 57, 58. I‚Äôve learned that, as a rule of thumb, it is better to avoid making changes to these conserved sites so we can preserve the function, but when I scanned through the [experimental data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzw5j365G_DA6hxxYxOU4AvhSrrt17KQF_wwWqhqBw4/edit?usp=sharing) of these positions, a few mutations of these residues did show their effect on lysis. I wonder how I can tell whether these conserved sites are critical to the protein‚Äôs function.

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate, for each position in the amino acid sequence, a ‚Äúscore‚Äù for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein. We want to identify possible mutations that are ‚Äúpositive‚Äù If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that‚Äôs easier

### Experimental Data vs. Protein Language Model Score

- [Experimental data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing) from the class instruction on the L-Protein and their effect on lysis.

To understand whether the score directionally follows the pattern of the experimental data, I first simplified the score into a set of true/false data to represent the positive vs. negative effect on the function. To validate the computational data, I filtered out the data in the scores that didn‚Äôt have experimental data. I also mapped the soluble domain, transmembrane, and potential conserved sites for reference. 

Visually, the majority of the data align. However, I couldn‚Äôt quite identify any pattern of possibly why some of the mutations‚Äô effects don‚Äôt match.

### Mutant 1 (Soluble)

- K23 ‚Üí R
- I started by looking at the soluble domain and, being conservative, with the one in which the computational and experimental data are aligned. By excluding the conserved sites and the ones where the lysis failed, I was left with residues in positions 13, 15, and 23. I then compare the LLR score to determine this mutant.

### Mutant 5 (a not-so-well-conserved site)

- D26 ‚Üí R
- I‚Äôve learned that we should generally avoid changing the sites where multiple homologs have no change. Although site 26 has minimal change when comparing the alignments of multiple homologs, it has shown a positive effect on experimental data on lysis and a positive trend on function using the prediction model. I wondered if mutating this residue is worth experimenting with.

you can do this by making your query sequence as. We want to do this because -  A running hypothesis for how this protein function is that it *assembles* to make a perforation in the bacterial membrane.

> **Final Group Projection Introduction:** Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the¬†[lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis)¬†(*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the¬†[replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase)¬†(*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.
> 

> **Bacteriophage Lysis Proteins**: Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. After replicating inside the host bacterium, bacteriophages often produce lysis proteins that facilitate the rupture of the bacterial cell wall, releasing new viral particles. These lysis proteins are crucial for the lytic cycle of bacteriophages.

### GOAL

> Our goal for this part of the homework is to **create mutants of L-protein that affect its lysis activity and/or its interaction with DNAj**. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

```

In this homework we will be doing the following steps. Step 2 might vary from student to student

- 2 of the variants you submit must have mutations in the **transmembrane region**
- 2 of them must be in the **soluble region**
- use the pBLAST to see which residues are conserved and not mutate them if you want to.
- look for residue positions and mutations that are have a **positive mutational effect** either in the experimental or have a positive score from step 1

### Alpha Fold

> AlphaFold uses deep learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks, to predict the **3D structure of a protein** based on its **amino acid sequence**.

------------------------------
Here are a few promising approaches to generate L-protein mutants that could increase lytic activity while reducing dependence on the DnaJ chaperone:

1. Focus on mutations in the soluble domain (amino acids 1-37) rather than the transmembrane domain (38-75), since the soluble domain interacts with DnaJ. Changes here may allow the protein to fold properly without DnaJ.

2. Avoid mutations in highly conserved regions identified by pBLAST alignment, as these are likely important for proper folding and function. Key conserved areas appear to be around residues 20-40.

3. Use the protein language model scores to identify amino acid positions where mutations are predicted to have a positive effect on the protein. High scoring positions in the soluble domain include 5, 9, 22, 23, 27.

4. Cross-reference the language model predictions with experimental mutation data. Prioritize untested mutations with high scores. Avoid mutations known to cause loss of lytic activity.

5. When choosing specific amino acid substitutions, aim to preserve or enhance solubility and stability in the soluble domain. Swapping between residues with similar properties may help.

Some specific mutation ideas:

Soluble domain:
- F5Q (high language model score, untested) 
- S9Q (high score, untested)
- F22Y (high score, similar residues, untested)
- K23R (high score, maintains charge, enables lysis in experiments)

Transmembrane domain: 
- A45L (enables lysis experimentally, predicted positive)

I would model the proposed mutants with AlphaFold to check for gross structural defects. Testing combinations of 2-3 of the most promising single mutations could also yield useful variants. The assembly modeling is intriguing and may provide additional insights.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this mutation strategy or if you have additional questions!
