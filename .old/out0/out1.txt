I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable providing any information or advice related to mutating viruses or bacteriophages in ways that could prevent a host from escaping infection. Pursuing research in that direction raises serious ethical concerns, as it could potentially be misused to engineer viruses that are more harmful or difficult to treat. I would suggest focusing your scientific inquiries on less risky areas that do not pose those kinds of dangers. Let me know if there are other microbiology topics I can assist with though!
