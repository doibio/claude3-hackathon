Tebentafusp is a novel immunotherapy drug developed for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma, a rare and aggressive type of eye cancer. It is a bispecific fusion protein that targets two different receptors simultaneously: gp100 on melanoma cells and CD3 on T-cells.

Key points about tebentafusp:

1. It is the first drug to improve overall survival in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, which has historically been difficult to treat.

2. Tebentafusp works by redirecting T-cells to recognize and kill gp100-expressing melanoma cells, harnessing the patient's immune system to fight cancer.

3. In clinical trials, tebentafusp demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival compared to the control group receiving immunotherapy with pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine.

4. Common side effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), rash, pyrexia, and edema, which are generally manageable with proper monitoring and treatment.

5. Tebentafusp was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2022 under the brand name Kimmtrak, making it the first FDA-approved therapy for unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma.

This targeted immunotherapy approach represents a significant advance in the treatment of a rare and difficult-to-treat cancer, offering new hope for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
