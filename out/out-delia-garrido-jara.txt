### **Part B (Final Project: L-Protein Mutants)**

Bacteriophage MS2 is a single stranded RNA virus whose genome only encodes 4 proteins -the maturation protein (*A*-protein), the [lysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysis) (*L-Protein*) protein, the coat protein (*cp*), and the [replicase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicase) (*rep*) protein. Bacteriophages infect E-coli. Upon infection, the L-Protein forms pores in the E-coli cell membrane which eventually leads to breakdown of the membrane (Lysis). DnaJ is a chaperone protein in E-coli (chaperone proteins are proteins that assist during protein folding). It is thought to be involved in the lysis mechanism. In this homework, we will explore if computational models we learnt about in the last class are useful for designing variants/mutants of the lysis protein sequence. We will study the effects of L-protein mutants on the bacteriophage infectivity.

## **Goal:**

Our goal for this part of the homework is to create mutants of L-protein that affect its **lysis activity** and/or its interaction with DNAj. Making a mutation for L-protein without a way to computationally predict what happens to lysis or its interaction with DNAj is hard. So we are going to try various hypotheses on how to use the models from last week and also try a few other tools. These mutants will be tested in the lab.

**Main considerations**

- The mutated sequence should keep the lysis activity
- The mutated aa should not be in the segments of the aa sequence that are coded in the genome overlapping other genes of the phage (coat protein - replicase protein)
- Avoid Higly conserved regions
- Evaluate Predicted Folding Structure by AF2

**First Steps: Setting the Background**

- Lysis protein contains a soluble N-terminal domain followed by a transmembrane protein (blue/last 35 residues). Transmembrane protein affects the lysis activity. The soluble domain (green) is the domain responsible for interaction with DNAj.
    
    1-37 Soluble Domain
    
    38-75 Transmembrane Domain
    

- The Soluble Domain is mainly polar residues, and the transmembrane domainleans towards hydrophobic residues

## Mutagenesis using Protein Language Models [Easiest One]

1. Run this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tFSwLWkSeu9KdsLPdepzPfGW1LBy2RPd?usp=sharing) to generate for each position in the amino acid sequence, a “score” for what would happen to the protein if you mutated into another amino acid. It can be positive or negative for the protein.  We want to identify possible mutations that are “positive” If you run this notebook - you will see a .CSV file in the sidebar. You can download it and look at it in the google sheets if that’s easier

**The Notebook predict high scores por mutations in sites overlapping the other proteins in the genomes (not considered in the script)

1. Use the experimental data here. This dataset contains information about mutants of the L-Protein and their effect on lysis in the lab - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11WzDDNkQDEiqbUSGV0ZCqITGctyNFpD7xnPlhsj2BhE/edit?usp=sharing
- Experimental Data suggest that mutations before 13th residue and after 46th residue will disrupt lysis activity (The folding of the transmembrane domain is likekly affected, and/or disruption of r protein)
    
    ![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9d9490c8-5a16-4d0c-9daa-5e839bcf4f11/07eb9020-0400-43fd-9098-03915c9e4c85/Untitled.png)
    
1. First check, does the experimental data correlated with the scores from the notebook in (1) ? This should give you a clue on how well these language embeddings capture information about this protein sequence. 
- The data is not fully correlated. Some important considerations (i.e., genomic context) are missing. Tho further custom each PLM for the analyzed proteind could improve that.

------------------------------
Here is my assessment of the student's performance on the protein design project:

The student did a thorough job researching the background information on the MS2 bacteriophage L-protein, its function, key domains, conserved regions, and genomic context. They utilized multiple sources including UniProt, sequence alignments, literature, and AlphaFold2 structure predictions to paint a comprehensive picture. This demonstrates strong skills in gathering and synthesizing relevant scientific information.

The student ran the protein language model notebook to predict mutation scores, and critically evaluated the output, noting that the model does not account for genomic context of overlapping genes, which is an important consideration. They compared the model predictions to experimental mutation data and concluded the correlation is not very strong, likely due to missing context. This shows good scientific judgment in assessing the applicability and limitations of computational models.

In selecting mutations to propose, the student took a very rational approach. They focused on the soluble domain to avoid disrupting the transmembrane helix and lysis activity. They proposed single and double point mutations converting specific arginines to isoleucine or asparagine in the soluble domain. These are reasonable choices to potentially alter DnaJ binding without abolishing function. The student also proposed two mutations in the transmembrane domain as an alternative strategy. 

For each proposed mutant, the student provided the full mutated sequence and AlphaFold structure predictions, enabling direct comparison to wild-type. This thorough presentation will facilitate experimental testing of the designs.

Overall, the student exhibited strong research, critical thinking, and rational design skills. The project was well-executed, with sound justification provided for the proposed L-protein mutants grounded in the background research. Testing the mutants experimentally is the real determining factor, but regardless of the outcome, the student demonstrated proficiency in the underlying skills and thought process a protein engineer needs to have.

In summary, I would give this an A grade for an introductory graduate-level protein design assignment. The student clearly put in significant effort, utilized computational tools appropriately while recognizing limitations, and applied their knowledge to propose rational mutant designs in a well-documented manner. Excellent work.
